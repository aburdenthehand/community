## Membership Policy

This document is primarily concerned with governance for project maintainers, as well as Special Interest Groups (SIGs), Subprojects, and Working Groups (WGs).
We have a separate [membership policy](.membership-policy.md) document that details our contributor ladder and criteria for our other roles, such as new members, reviewers, approvers, SIG and WG chairs, and Subproject leads.

## Maintainers

KubeVirt maintainers govern the project. Maintainers collectively manage the 
project's resources and contributors, and speak for the project in public. The
maintainers collectively decide any questions that cannot be resolved at the 
individual repository level, and provide strategic guidance for the project
overall.

The current maintainers can be found in [MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md).

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers
are people who care about the KubeVirt project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who
has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and
follow through to fix issues.

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping
the project succeed.

### Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers share the highest level of responsibilities for the project and take the broadest viewpoint.
They help steer the technical direction of the project as well as shepherd the community so that it is always forward thinking and sustainable.

The core responsibilities of our maintainers are: 

  * Responsive to issues raised on the [cncf-maintainers list](mailto:cncf-kubevirt-maintainers@lists.cncf.io).
  * Responsive to issues raised on the [security list and CVEs](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to coordinate and prioritize remediation.
  * Guide the direction of the project by regularly reviewing and facilitating:
  	** Enhancement Proposals.
  	** Critical PRs.
  	** Organizational changes.
  * Lead by example with regard to following and working to improve processes and workflows in the project.
  * Mediate any conflict that may arise on reviews, proposals, in meetings, or on the mailing list or slack channels.
  * Represent the project by speaking at events and meetups and participating in interviews and press releases.

### Selecting Maintainers

The current project maintainers will periodically review contributor activities
to see if additional project members may be promoted to maintainers. 

For nominations, the maintainers will look at the following criteria:

  * Commitment to the project: have they participated in discussions, 
    contributions, and reviews for 1 year or more?
  * Does the person show leadership in one of these areas?
    * Active approver or reviewer in core or subprojects
    * SIG leadership
    * Mentoring other project contributors
  * Does the candidate bring new perspectives or community connections to the 
    maintainers?
  * Do they understand how the project works (policies, processes, etc)?
  * Are they willing to take on the additional duties of a maintainer?

A candidate must be proposed by an existing maintainer by filing an PR in the
[Community Repo](https://github.com/kubevirt/community) against the MAINTAINERS.md file. 
A simple majority vote of +1s from existing maintainers approves the application. 
Approved maintainers will be added to the [private maintainer mailing list](mailto:cncf-kubevirt-maintainers@lists.cncf.io).

### Meetings

Time zones permitting, maintainers are expected to participate in the weekly public
community meeting or SIG meetings. A list of these meetings is available in our [sig-list](sig-list.md).

Maintainers will also have closed meetings in order to discuss security reports
or Code of Conduct violations.  Such meetings should be scheduled by any
maintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report.  All current maintainers
must be invited to such closed meetings, except for any maintainer who is
accused of a CoC violation.

### CNCF Resources

Any maintainer may suggest a request for CNCF resources, in the
[developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev), 
the [maintainer mailing list](mailto:cncf-kubevirt-maintainers@lists.cncf.io), on Github, 
or during a community meeting.  A simple majority of maintainers approves the 
request.  The maintainers may also choose to delegate working with the CNCF to 
non-maintainer community members.

### Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)
violations by community members will be discussed and resolved
on the [private maintainer mailing list](mailto:cncf-kubevirt-maintainers@lists.cncf.io).  If the reported CoC violator
is a maintainer, the maintainers will instead designate two maintainers to work
with CNCF staff in resolving the report.

### Off-boarding Maintainers and Mentorship

Maintainers can voluntarily retire at any time, and should always feel that they can rely
on others to continue their good work. When a maintainer leaves, the project loses valuable 
knowledge and history.

To facilitate this process, it is encouraged that maintainers recognize when they no longer
have sufficient time to give to the project and engage in a mentorship with a possible
maintainer candidate from the community. Through this process, they can help transition some of their experience
and guide the candidate through expectations of the role.

### Retiring and Removing Maintainers

A maintainer can retire or be removed as a maintainer by filing an PR in the
[Community repo](https://github.com/kubevirt/community) against the [MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md) file and moving to Emeritus.

Maintainers may also be demoted at any time for one of the following reasons:

* Inactivity, including 6 months or more of non-participation or non-communication,
* Refusal to abide by this Governance,
* Violations of the Code of Conduct,
* Other actions that harm the reputation, stability, or harmony of the KubeVirt
  project.

Removing a maintainer requires a 2/3 majority vote of the other maintainers.
An emeritus maintainer holds a special place in the project's history and can be reinstated by a majority vote of the current maintainers.

### Voting

While most business in KubeVirt is conducted by "lazy consensus", periodically
the maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.
A vote can be taken on [the developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev) or
the private maintainer mailing list for security or conduct matters. 
Votes may also be taken at the community meeting.  Any maintainer may
request a vote be taken.

Most votes require a simple majority of all maintainers to succeed. maintainers
can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all maintainers, and changes to this
Governance require a 2/3 vote of all maintainers.

## SIGs

The KubeVirt project is organized primarily into Special Interest Groups, or SIGs.
Each SIG is comprised of members from multiple companies and organizations, with a
common purpose of advancing the project with respect to a specific topic, such as
Networking or Storage. Our goal is to enable a distributed decision structure
and code ownership, as well as providing focused forums for getting work done,
making decisions, and onboarding new contributors. Every identifiable subpart of
the project (e.g., github org, repository, subdirectory, API, test, issue, PR)
is intended to be owned by some SIG.

Our SIGs define mission and scope via their charters, ownership of code via
[OWNERS](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/owners/), and members and roles in
[sigs.yaml].

For more details see also the [Kubernetes SIGs] model.

Examples:
* [sig-network - charter](./sig-network/charter.md)
* [sig-network - kubevirt/kubevirt OWNERS_ALIASES](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/a7e0311d8704663351abd4bc9bbc8511753d2838/OWNERS_ALIASES#L60)
* [sig-ci - sigs.yaml](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/blob/4f63a79c0ed810aa332cd6716d4986001d28bcd7/sigs.yaml#L119)

### Subprojects

Specific work efforts within SIGs are divided into subprojects. Every part of the
KubeVirt code and documentation must be owned by some subproject. Some [SIGs](#sigs)
may have a single subproject, but many SIGs have multiple significant subprojects
with distinct (though sometimes overlapping) sets of contributors and owners, who
act as subprojectâ€™s technical leaders: responsible for vision and direction and
overall design, choose/approve design proposals approvers, field technical
escalations, etc.

For more details see also the [Kubernetes Subprojects] model.

## Working Groups

We need community rallying points to facilitate discussions/work regarding topics
that are short-lived or that span multiple SIGs.

Working groups are primarily used to facilitate topics of discussion that are in
scope for KubeVirt but that cross SIG lines.

Our WGs define mission and scope via their charter, and members and roles in
 [sigs.yaml].

For more details see also the [Kubernetes WGs] model.
